# RAD_9_5_Module_Mendix – Mendix-Based Application for Research Implementation

This Mendix project is a practical implementation of the research work titled:

**"Low-Code Application Development Using Mendix: A Study on Rapid Prototyping and Deployment for [Insert Domain/Use Case]"**

This application demonstrates how low-code platforms like Mendix can be effectively used to build scalable, modular, and rapidly deployable applications with minimal hand-coding.

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to support and validate the findings of the research by:

- Applying Rapid Application Development principles
- Showcasing modular design with reusable components
- Demonstrating third-party library integration
- Enabling faster deployment cycles using Mendix Studio Pro

## 🔧 Project Structure

- `modules/` – Contains domain models, logic flows, and UI pages
- `userlib/` – Java libraries used for extended functionality
- `vendorlib/` – External or third-party libraries
- `resources/` – Static assets for UI
- `RAD_9_5_Module_7.mpr` – Main Mendix project file

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Install **Mendix Studio Pro (9.5 or above)**
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Open the `.mpr` file in Mendix Studio Pro
4. Click **Run Locally** to start the app

## 📝 Research Context

This project supports a research paper exploring:
- The efficiency of low-code development
- Practical advantages of using Mendix in academic and real-world use-cases
- Application of reusable components and external libraries in a modular environment
